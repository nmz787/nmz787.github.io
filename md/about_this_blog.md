# About this blog
I needed a place to post about projects, wanted minimal overhead, wanted it to look decent, and be easy to add to and maintain.  
When I saw people using github.io for blogging, I thought it was a great idea since a lot of what I might blog about get's put on github anyway!  

I found some styling I liked, but the software overhead was more than I wanted. After spending a few hours coding, I think I have something that will be easy to publish new posts with. I wrote about 60 lines of code and pieced-together and modified around 130 lines from various sources online, but most notably from [Eric Jones](http://erjjones.github.io/blog/How-I-built-my-blog-in-one-day/).

It seems pretty good so far, a lot more 'modern' than the almost-plaintext HTML I am generally OK with.
